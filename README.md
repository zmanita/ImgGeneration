# ImgGeneration
This repository explores generative modeling using DCGANs, Progressive GANs, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Experiments include training on synthetic geometric datasets and real-world animal image datasets, analyzing training stability, latent space interpolation, and visual quality.
